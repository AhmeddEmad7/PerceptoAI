          'The scientific consensus on the healthiest diet centers around patterns rather than a single "perfect" diet. Research consistently supports diets rich in minimally processed plant foods, with limited ultra-processed foods and added sugars. The Mediterranean diet has the strongest evidence base for long-term health benefits, featuring vegetables, fruits, whole grains, legumes, nuts, olive oil, moderate fish, and limited red meat. Other beneficial patterns include the traditional Okinawan diet, the DASH diet, and plant-forward approaches.\n\nNutrition science recognizes individual variation in responses to foods based on genetics, gut microbiome, lifestyle, and health status. This supports personalized approaches rather than one-size-fits-all recommendations. Common principles across healthy dietary patterns include emphasizing whole foods, plant predominance, healthy fats, fiber-rich carbohydrates, and adequate protein while limiting ultra-processed foods, added sugars, and excessive salt.',
